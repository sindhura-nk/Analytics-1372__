Student marks 
sample mean - 78
sample st dev - 15
calculate the Total students mean score range considering 95% C.I 
z = 2
range = mean +- zscore(standard deviation)
= 78 + - 2(15)
= 78 +- 30
ranges = intervals = (48,108)

calculate considering 88% C.I
consider z score for 88% as 1.55

interval range = 78 +-(1.55)*15
 = (54.75,101.25)


Suppose that an accounting firm does a study to determine the time needed to complete one person’s tax forms. It randomly surveys 100 people. The sample mean is 23.6 hours. There is a known standard deviation of 7.0 hours. The population distribution is assumed to be normal.

x¯= mean = 23.6
  ________
σ= 7
  ________
n= 100
  ________


Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean time to complete the tax forms.
 standard error = standard deviation/square root of n
		= 7/sqrt(100)
		= 7/10
		standard error =0.7
zscore of 95% = 2

confidence intervals are = mean + - zscore * standard error
			= 23.6 +- (2*0.7)
			= 23.6 +- (1.4)
 interval for the population mean time to complete the tax forms = (22.2,25)in hours
